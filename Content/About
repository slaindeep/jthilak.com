I lead a premier legal consultancy delivering tailored corporate legal solutions across borders. With over 23 years of PQE, including 22 years in the Middle East, I've developed expertise as an International Corporate, Commercial, and Investment Lawyer and strategist.

As a pioneer in investment law and major contract negotiations, I empower businesses—from SMEs to multinational corporations—with strategic, cost-effective legal solutions that drive growth and reduce risk. At Luminous Legal Partners, we're more than legal advisors; we're trusted partners offering customized legal frameworks that adapt to changing global environments.

As Associate General Counsel for leading PIF Projects, I navigate complex legal frameworks across real estate, hospitality, and sustainability sectors, guiding major projects through intricate regulatory landscapes. My expertise includes building international legal departments, addressing complex legal and compliance challenges, and strengthening corporate governance and operational integrity.

My foundation in strategic negotiation has helped secure important contract outcomes aligned with organizational goals and regulatory requirements. I also serve as a visiting professor and fellow at prestigious law universities in the UAE, France, Canada, and the USA, mentoring future legal, business, and sustainability leaders. I've contributed 20+ international publications to global corporate and investment law discussions.

I champion the integration of sustainability principles with legal expertise, fostering initiatives that maintain regulatory excellence while promoting environmental and social benefits. Through comprehensive legal management, I empower organizations and drive success in dynamic, globally impactful projects. Let's connect to explore collaboration opportunities!
