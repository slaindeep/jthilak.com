Preliminary Comments:
1.	Website Design & Structure Preference- I prefer the earlier website design, colors, etc. I hope this is only for the literature, and the format and structure 
2.	Font Size for TFF Logo
o	The font size for the TFF logo on all pages needs to be increased. The logo and name are not displaying clearly at the top of the pages.
3.	Avoid Using 'AI' as a Term
o	As discussed, we will avoid using 'AI' as a term on the site. Instead, use the following alternatives:
	Technology-Enabled Solutions
	System-Driven Solutions
	Advanced Automation Systems
	Smart Legal Systems
	Intelligent Legal Platforms
	Machine Learning-Powered Solutions
	Digital Legal Solutions
	Next-Gen Legal Technology
	Automated Legal Tools
4.	Landing Page Heading
o	How about changing the landing page heading to: “Your Strategic Partner for Cutting-Edge Corporate Legal Solutions”?
5.	Landing Page Description
o	Update the landing page description to align with:
“Top-Tier Legal Services in Dubai & Fractional General Counsel Across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. 25+ Years of Expertise in Corporate, Commercial, and Contract Law, Cross-Border Solutions, Foreign Investment Advisory, and Advising Startups, SMEs, Government Projects, Real Estate, Hospitality, Tourism, and Technology Companies. Specializing in Technology-Enabled and System-Driven Legal Solutions.”
6.	Profile Update
o	For "My Profile," please use Founder, CEO & Chief Legal Counsel.
o	Remove the "work experience" section and replace it with a profile description that does not include a history of work.
7.	Articles Section
o	Add my name as the author of articles (do not list "TFF Legal Team" since TFF Legal did not exist in 2024).
8.	Legal Resource Section
o	Let's remove the Legal Resource section for now. We can add it later when we have a critical mass of content or if the firm grows with more team members. For now, keep it simple with just articles.
9.	Privacy & Terms of Use
o	Please remove the privacy email, phone, and address. Only the info@tfflegal.com email should remain.
10.	Firm Name Clarification
o	The firm’s name is Thilak Fons & Farabi Legal FZ LLE, not LLC.
o	Use TFF Legal as the name throughout the site except in legal notices sections. For marketing and client-facing sections, always use TFF Legal.
11.	Contact Us Section
•	Update the Contact Us section to:
o	info@tfflegal.com
o	jitheesh@tfflegal.com
(Replace @jthilak.com)
11.	Location
•	Always list the location as UAE. Do not mention Dubai specifically, as we are a Fujairah-registered company with no offices outside Fujairah. So, refer to the location as UAE.
12.	Cross-Border Expertise
•	The mention of Cross-Border Expertise (International transactions and compliance) is repetitive. We should focus more on Corporate, Commercial, Contracts, Investment Structures, Compliance, and related areas.
